## First Use Information
This is how your homepage should look after logging into Transkribus

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0674fcc6-90f7-4ca7-ba31-68cd5295bc4f" width=60% height=60%>

* In the top left corner, there are 3 main sections you can go to in Transkribus: "Home", "Collections", and "Tags"  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ad32762-6a16-41d7-a4cf-d84b84da9868" width=30% height=30%>

* To access all Camerarius documents, click on "Collections". You will find a personal collection, a test, and the "Digital Camerarius" collection.
* The Digital Camerarius collection is currently where all our transcription work is being done.
* The "Test" collection is available for first-time users to play around with the tools Transkribus offers, without having to worry about messing up pages we are currently working on. Anything in the "Test" collection is allowed to be modified, deleted, or changed. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/262716fc-6a0c-44c3-8d72-fc99f94bb546" width=80% height=80%>

* The Camerarius collection is divided into sections to maintain order with page/emblem transcription. When uploading entries (emblem and page(s)), be sure to do the same.
  
* To change the name of the sections, simply click the three dots on the bottom right of the section

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7967cd91-f67f-4d9a-ba88-85b7a22a2ffa" width=40% height=40%>

* Then, click "Edit Metadata"
* From there you can change the Title, add a description, etc.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178754a3-5e08-4fdb-a94f-f1fa4fbf6dde" width=50% height=50%>

* Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Save"

## Uploading and managing documents 

* Click on "Upload Files" in the top right corner
  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a405bb7-7d9b-4ec3-bedf-03ef2794dffb" width=40% height=40%>

* There is a box to name your documents
* You can either drag and drop your files directly into Transkribus, or click browse and choose from your own files.
* Click submit and wait for your files to upload.

## Using an automatic transcription and layout model 
In order to generate a transcription using an AI text recognition model, you can go about it two ways.

1. For one page:
* Open the page you want to transcribe and click on the "Start automatic transcription" button
* This will bring you to a page that lists all available public models to use. For the Camerarius project, we are using the Noscemus GM 6 model.
* Click on the text model and click "Start Recognition" in the top right corner

2. For multiple pages:
* Check the box in the bottom left corner of each page you want transcribed
  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d07dc0f0-b288-4ff0-a902-0652e5454bf7" width=40% height=40%>

* Then click the "[T] Recognize" button. This will bring you to the text recognition model page
  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4765e735-1261-404a-8ce6-7ce636fefa38" width=40% height=40%>
  
* Select AI model and start recognition. 

Information on Noscemus GM 6:
* Trained on Antiqua-based print 
* Recognizes Greek shorthand: -ος ending
* Recognizes Latin shorthand: et symbol, shorthand for atque (atq), long 's'
* Seems to have the most issues recognizing accents (eg. putting an accent where it isn't, leaving out accents, or putting in the wrong accents)
* Has problems mixing up lower-case 'e' with 'a' or 'o'

## Transcribing a page 

* To add/create a line, go to the far left toolbar and click on "Add a Line"
* Click once on the place you want your line to start, then click twice where you want your line to stop. 

# Preliminary transcription guidelines

* Page numbers do not need to be transcribed.
* The Roman numeral entry numbers at the top of the page do not need to be transcribed.
* Any typos should be fixed in the transcription and do not need to be tagged.
* All Greek symbols should be fully resolved in the transcription and do not need to be tagged.
* There is no need to capitalize the second letter at the top of each page. Transcribe the word as it is.
  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0920f055-9320-4959-be80-5726886a9d39" width=60% height=60%>

  In this example, 'UT' should be transcribed as 'Ut'.

## Use of Tags 

### How to enable tags
* To tag something in your transcription, you must enable tags first. To do so, go to the bar on the far right of your transcription page and click the arrow that says "Tags". 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a71b28b-3276-47f3-90e6-c8faceeef9f9" width=70% height=70%>

* Highlight your desired word(s) with your mouse. This will pull up an array of tags you can use.  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf0168a-8d8e-47ea-bc0d-ab61c23e82eb" width=60% height=60%>   

* In this example, you would use the "Language" tag
* Simply click on the desired tag and fill whatever information that tag needs.   

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c595c08-e31a-4c85-b928-39e74fe1d286" width=60% height=60%>   

* Here, the you would enter "Ancient Greek" as the language. Information about Wikidata ID is explained further in the "Other" section below.

### Creating and Editing tags
* To create tags, click on the "Tags" button in the top left of your dashboard.
* Select the "Digital Camerarius" collection.
* It will bring you to a page that allows you to manage your tags, change elements from pre-existing tags, create, and delete tags.
* There are two kinds of tags we use: textual, and structural

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec0349fc-096e-4d26-9908-b9fd54da2cd2" width=60% height=60%>   

* The drop down allows you to switch between viewing your structural tags, and your textual tags.
* Textual tags are what you use on the textual page of Camerarius entries
* Structural tags are what you use on the emblem page of Camerarius entries

* To create new tags, simply click on the "Create New" button right next to the drop down.
* You can name the tag, choose the color it will show up as, and add atributes to the tag.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908c2c95-e020-42a4-8b78-134fcddb1126" width=60% height=60%>   

* When you are satisfied with your tag, click the "Create" button at the bottom of the page. You may need to refresh Transkribus a few times before it shows up in your collection.
* To edit tags, simply click the pencil on whatever tag you want to change. Once done, click "Save".

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7fbda1-1cd5-4774-8f22-7d92c1394a57" width=60% height=60%>   

### Getting your new tags in text
* When you create a new tag, it will not show up immediately on your page. You must open your transcription first, and highlight the word(s) you want to tag.
* Instead of choosing a tag, click on "Tag Settings"

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c083500-e652-4278-a56c-c8c63147222d" width=60% height=60%>   

* This will bring you to a page comprizing of all the tags you have made for that collection. Just like the big Tag section, you can also switch between textual and structural tags using the drop down.
* Then, click the button in the "Visibility" column. This will make that tag "visible" in your collection.

### Abbreviations and shorthand 

* All abbreviations and shorthand must be resolved using the Transkribus "abbr" tag. The fully expanded word should be typed inside the "expansion" field.

### Proper names 

* Names should be tagged using the "person" tag.
* There is no need to use the Person tag if it is in relation to a quotation or citation that has already been tagged. If the person does not have any reference tied to them in the text, then the Person tag may be used. 

### Citations and Quotations of other authors

A **Citation** is any reference to an outside author or work. For example, Aristotle lib. IV. cap. I.  
Citations will often contain abbreviated versions of authors names and work titles. These should be resolved as much as it is reasonable in the citation tag. Further research may reveal the correct way to resolve these citations.  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13dd89b-4270-481e-9927-98169966bfd3" width=50% height=50%>


**Quotations** will contain any direct quotes and should be tagged as Quotations. The Quotation tag has space for information about the author of the quote. Instead of using the Person tag for a reference, just use the Quotation tag.

See below in this document for researching quotations and citations (https://github.com/ChiaraPalladino/furesearch/blob/main/manuscript-transcription/README.md#tutorial-for-researching-quotationswords)

### Other 

* **Unclear elements** should be marked with the "unclear" tag. A question may be typed in the "question" attribute.
* **Words in a different language** than Latin need to be marked with the "language" tag on Transkribus and the language needs to be specified in the "language" attribute. This will often be Ancient Greek. You may also use the Wikidata identifier Q35497 (click on Wikidata ID and type "Ancient Greek" in the search window).

## Tutorial for researching quotations/words
First look up the author of the quotation in either library (scaife or philogic)
* Scaife: https://scaife.perseus.org/search/?q=neredum&kind=form&format=instances&p=1
* Philogic: https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/Greek/ 

Using Scaife, 
* Searching for the author will pull up their bibliography
* Sometimes the spelling doesnt match the citation
* Usually the longer the quotation the more accurate the spelling

Using Philogic,
* You have to search by the lemma
* It will pull up a bunch of options to choose from

Look up word in Logeion to see if Camerarius made a spelling error or if he's just using another form of the word

## Transkribus shortcuts and info:

To divide a region or line:
* click on region/line of interest
* press and hold V (vertical) or H (horizontal)
* use slider to make your split

To move a region or line:
* click on region/line
* press and hold shift
* use slider to move up, down, expand, or minimize

Three dots in top right corner shows extra keyboard shortcuts

"Jobs" button shows progress on an automatic transcription

The hamburger on the right is the "Layout" button. This allows you to change the order of lines in your transcription. 

## Observations about Transkribus:
It sometimes randomly deletes tags I've created 
* solution: make sure you click somewhere else on your transcription so the software registers it as a "change" before you save and exit.

Transkribus has a number of keyboard shortcuts to be used in transcriptions. The problem with this is that some of the shortcuts only require you to press a certain letter on your keyboard (ie. pressing W allows you to zoom out) which has proven to be an issue when I am trying to fix mistakes or put info into tags that use that letter. 

It is VERY reliant on how good your wifi/cell service is. 

Be sure to save as you work. If you wait till you are done with a document, the software will freak out and won't save your work. I usually click save every 5-10 changes just to be safe.
